Assignment 3

This is a demonstration of static pages. It includes forms (including password hiding),
links, and dynamic Jade loops to generate the list of notes page.

The only piece of the assignmnent I was not able to figure out was
how to disable the menu button for the current page.

Additional pieces included truncating the content section of the notes to give a preview.  Several
elements of the books Loc8r project were repurposed, including the overal theme, and the "distance" changed to 
a "views" counter.
